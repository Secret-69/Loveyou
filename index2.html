                Ashawaikum, This is me writing these words around 3 am at night where i have insomnia and overthinking about you. 
                I have a laptop, a phone and my pillow. I really dont know what direction this is supposed to go, but i just want
                to wish you a very happy birthday. I hope you pray 2 rakat of shukrana namaz to thank allah, during the same night.
                <br><br>

                Have you considered that whatver i say, can this be a reason for him loosing his dad ?, do u even know how it is to loose someone u love
                so much permanently without any notice ? I have been frustrated not because of you but because of what happened to me. Have u thought that,
                "He is grumpy, he must be overthnking and missing his dad". I cry everyday and everyady i miss my dad. Do u know how frustrating it is.
                If u loved me, u couldve loved me instead of seeing my words. Thats love. if i say "I hate you" , u shouldve said "I dont care, i love you". 
                Do u feel i can be happy and not overthink after i loose my dad ? , i lost my goals, dreams, forget that, i didnt want to live anymore. 
                Can u keep ur hand on ur heart if its there, and ask one question, "Did i take care of him in his situation?". No, u actually,
                started doing more worst things in front of my face like sitting next to zeeshan, replying other guys messages, lying, throwing tantrums, etc.
                I feel so so hurt. and i did feel the same that time. if i was at ur position, i would have let you shout at me, hit me, do whatever
                u want with me until u feel comfortable and happy and forget about ut problems. Dont u think, that u were never there when i always needed u the most?
                whereas i was there everytime u needed me.
                <br><br>
                
                U take my hurtful words and u already are okay with leaving me, just because i said things like "i have another woman", or
                "my family doesnt like u". Like seriously ? There has been uncountable moments which u have forgotten. Did u forget, u sat sticking
                to zeeshan and shared mouse and jokes with him ? when my dad passed away i never got 1 moment of emotional support from u at all.
                i got lied, heart broken, and said "Everyone has a past, u dont have to take it so seriously". what do i ask from you after all this?
                do u realise ? I still only ask that you just dont repeat those things like lying, being around men, wearing propoer clothes, etc.
                <br><br>

                I have observed that, just because i have said hurtful words, u have given up on our love. Keep your hand on ur heart
                and say with honesty would u mind if i talked and flirted with other girls, if i just said very sweet words to u everyday
                like "Good morning honey boo, i love uu". The answer is no u wouldnt mind. You completely disobey everything, the contract
                which had ur blood and everything. Dont u have any committments in life? The promises you make, u cant break them just because
                u are upset ? i feel ashamed to call u anything. If u are confused, u can call me anytime and tell me honestly, "miu, i am confused
                , i dont know what to do, u keep saying to improve and i dont know what it means or how to do it". and ill help you?
                <br><br>
                
                And yes, if u think nobody will judge u based on ur appearance then u are wrong. especially in family matters. i know i did wrong
                saying many bad things to you. but can u once put urself in my position ? , imagine u love someone more than urself and they suddenly
                start showing so many changes and keep betraying ur trust every single day. Even now, u said "Contract is nothing", when u literally
                forged it with ur blood. Does everything matter to you based on ur mood? one day u can say i love you, and second day, immediately
                just because of any any matter u  can say "u can leave me if u want"?. I did say rude and mean things to you because what can i do ?
                Imagine u love someone and they completely broke ur trust and keep doing it even after saying "i love you". Yes? did u imagine?
                Now how can u deal with it ? Maybe u wouldve cutoff from that person, which wouldve been a very good idea. But i just wasnt prepared
                to livee without you. Yes, i stayed and i hurt u too. Because i ccouldnt imagine living without you. 
                <br><br>

                I found a good way that i get ur attention as well as i see u sad. But u never did anything to make situations better. Even now,
                u told me "Life is short, everyone in my family is meeting their friends on new year and we are sad here", but i dont think like this.
                i feel that if i love someone, even if i have to go through million of sadness, i still want to have them. I dont forget my promises or the
                moments we spend together. either new year or eid, i dont have a single issue with being sad by you. I love you and i am prepared
                to go through every moment with you. whether its sad, happy or lonely. I can never sit and instead of finding a solution to a problem,
                i can say, "we should be happy, lets forget about this".
                <br><br>

                I didnt defend u infront of my family because whatever they said, wallahi , i know u are not that. But if u remember,
                i keep telling u , "affu, beauty is everything for a woman". But u dont take care of ur health and appearance even when
                i have told u to take care of ur skin and health uncountable times. Remember that time i showed u pictures of other girls and 
                called them hot for u to be jealous and improve ur appearance again ? i have tried many ways for you to do what is better for you.
                <br><br>

                I have loved u since start, no matter what happens, either sad or happy. I cant live without ur care for me. No matter what
                i cant loose you at any cost. i came to know that what we were doing was haram and that haram relationships never make it, so i started
                doing a lot of distance from you. Why ? because i want you. i dont care what comes in my way. whether trust issues, family issues, compa
                tibility issues, or whatever. I am ready to teach u, and grow together. But please put urself in my position and think, 
                if ur love breaks ur trust, and u cant live without them, so instead of distancing, u chose to stay and keep hurting them in a toxic way,
                so that atleast u get to talk to them and dont feel like u still want him even tho he did wrong. i couldnt be away from you,
                yes i cant be away from you so i chose to say hurtful things so that i get to speak to u as well as it doesnt look like im desperate for u.
                <br><br>

                My committment to love is unimaginable. My father has taught me only love for my family and nothing else. And i want you to be a part of
                my family, i want you to kiss me and wake me up in morning, cuddle with me throughout the night, call me hubby 24/7 in front of ur parents,
                family and my family, i want you to call and annoy me at work, i want you to do fashion shows at weeknds at our home, i want us to cuddle And
                watch movies together, wear same nigthy and go to bed together. 
                <br><br>

                For this to happen, i dont care what i have to go through. Whether i have to see u lie, sitting next to somebody, overthink all night,
                have insomnia and overthinking, stress, less grades, I DONT CARE. if u want to know, i never even blamed u for anything in front of allah,
                i always said that its my fault and i kept improving. Regardless of how many problems, i just wanted to listen to you, but i know and seen 
                that woman treats u like an animal if u look desperate in fron of them, so i stuck to u but i said rude things which was a solution in my eyes.
                I really love you and you know that. But u have to change urself. U cant keep deciding whether to love someone or not, based, on
                their words. I really dont even care if u  call me anything, ill show that im mad to look like im not ur servent, but inside,
                it doesnt change anything. 
                <br><br>

                If i did say rude things and brought up another woman, i am sorry but please do give it a lookout from my pov. is it not, innocent 
                love? U get hurt so easily by just one or two words of mine, but have u thought how i felt looking at those instagram chats ??
                can u imagine how much i cried ? Those werent even words, what u did was all actions and yet for 1.5years, i couldnt say "i am leaving you",
                because i cant stop loving you. I said to you since day 1, i love you and u are someone i will never find again. Yes i did  go into, 
                a greiving period and said many bad things which is a part of grief. But my committment to you remains untouched. I literally, still
                dont give a damn about anyone or anything, i just want you to be happy and do good in akhirat. I really love you affu, and when a man
                says that he wants to marry you, when i said i want to marry you, i considered all possibilties and said that.
                <br><br>

                Yes u are stubborn and u dont change but instead of yelling, in  the future, i will sit and talk to you and find a solution.
                I am indeed very short tempered and emotional. I loose my mind when i see u doing things like sitting next to zeeshan or something,
                but if u just come and say sorry and hug me and tell me "it was my fault baby, If it ever happens again, ill slap myself on video till u say stop".
                thats what i want and thats what i will do for you. 
                <br><br>

                This is love. You have done a lot a lot of bad decisions in past. But dont u want to start a new year with my love as ur support ??
                If ur decision is Yes, i want to marry u rn miu. Then i have been preparing a solution to a halal relationship since december 1. 
                ill explain properly in person. 
                <br><br>

                I just want to say that, i love you, not because its ur bday or something. I dont even need to explain, just look back,
                look back on 2022, the days i found about ur past, many times saw u breaking every promise u made, "pinky promise,gold tier promise, promise" etc,
                i am still here, Still here saying, "i love you". This is the definition of love. Whereas if i did all this, u wouldve distanced yourself
                from me that day u would find that i had a past that i lied about, wont you ?. 
                <br><br>

                I never distanced myself because a person so naturally beautiful, soft-spoken, sweet, humble, caring, smartess woman,
                these qualities i could never have found anywhere else. so i kept, forgiving you for every thing u did. 
                <br><br>

                Even now, yes i have been stressed about plannings of ur bday and trying my best to think about best gifts and greetings,
                and also, u can say with confidence that we will marry inshallah, because if u prove to me that u love me, i will cry my 
                heart out to allah and anyhow like a stubborn child make him to let me marry you. Not everyone gets a chance to change a haram relationship
                into a halal one. but we do have a chance to fix everything. My niyyat is simple and with love of yours, it will keep strengthening,
                it is that no matter what u do to me, lie, disobey, ignore, break my trust, cause me depression, if at the end of the day, i can hear you
                saying "sleep on my lap", i can forget everything. All that matters to me is ur love. I dont care who it is and what they will
                judge me on, if after so much sadness and fights, if we both still love each other a lot, then we are meant to be together.
                <br><br>

                Once again, wishing you a very happy birthday, i hope inshallah my plans go well and my gifts u like. Inshallah Allah blesses u with
                great opportunities and success in your life. I love you >3



                <!--Aloo!, Uhmm i dont really know how to start this letter of love for you. Hmm, lets start it by you telling me 
                right now that "kiss me!", so i can start saying some things from my heart not because its your birthday. So,
                let me start. Imagine calling me hubby in future, sitting and eating, sleeping and laughing, and most importantly
                gaming and namazing with me. Call me hubby right now first. Please!. Come on dont be shy. Okay, now imagining ur red face
                i'll proceed with a nice vibe. you're 19 !!!. I am so happy that we have been together for almost 3 years now !??. Its crazy
                . I know many things are unsort and u are very angry with me and u dont probably want to speak to me. But i dont care,
                either by hurtful things or by lovable things, ill get u to be perfect and sorted in life. This moment i want you to forget
                every beef we had and focus on being with me more. Since day 1 , i have only stayed with you because i can never find anyone
                more perfect than you. Alhamdulillah , i am grateful to have you. I know things have been miserable but these moments of joy,
                they shouldnt be affected. I guarantee you , by the end of this day inshallah u will have much clarity and many answers to
                your questions. If i can give u a legal letter of marriage, i would really go ahead and do that, but but but. I wont do it
                until u are happy by yourself. I want to see u successful and happy, with or without me. Only allah knows how adorably we love 
                each other. <br><br>

                Sometimes , these tests are meant to test our love. I am ready to not speak to you for days, weeks, months or years if
                at the end i get you. i loved you not just because i felt lonely or bored. i loved you and comitted myself to you because
                i geniuenly want you to be my future wifey. i want u rn to put ur hand on ur heart and ask urself, does this person love me?
                or he just is here for fun or entertainment. The main reason for our bad times is because u are stuck at being with me. Whereas,
                i am too but i am using my brain to make u improve in ur akhirat as well as world.<br><br>

                Do you not want to wake up next to me ? Kiss me till i wake up ? sit on top of me and annoy me ? Call me for no reason
                and annoy me ? Hear me reciting quran while namazing ? Cook breakfast and feed it to me with ur kiss on top ? Hug and sleep
                in my arms at night ? Go on vacations and other countries with me ? Travel in luxurious cars with me ? Do u not want to 
                tell me that u love me everyday ? Do my face routine ?<br><br> 

                Imagine you wearing shorts and a tank top, cooking something while i sit and annoy u at the kitchen table. 
                <br><br>
                if you want all of this, what stops you from getting it ?? 
                <br><br>
                Can u think about anything that has caused us this situation ? I want to do hiking , ski-ing, sky diving, and soooo many things with you.
                going to resorts, villas, foreign, kaba shareef, madina shareef, soooooooo many places. Take 2 minutes, close ur eyes and Imagine
                all of this with me. U have 2 min, starting now.
                <br><br>
                Now, i have a question, if allah gives u a deal, u can get allll of these things, but u have to become a responsible and mature person.
                u have to spend 2-3 months learning all about religion, house reponsibilities, social relations, etc. You basically have to become
                perfect in less than 1 month. and he will test u at the end of the month if u have become perfect in all fields like self-control, hardworking,
                sincerity, obedient, loyal, and a very unique person. If you can become like that, allah will give u me for the rest of ur life,
                else u can loose me. What do u choose ? also remember, after one month, if u fail the tests of personality, u will permanently loose
                me. So what will u choose ?
                <br><br>
                I always say "ur personality personality", now let me tell u what u were exactly. Starting from the start. U were the only person to fearlessly 
                asnwer all the chemistry answers on first day while no one could even say "Hi" to each other. U were the person, the whole class had crush on but 
                no one had the guts to even say a "Hi" to you. U were the person who always handled conversation so smoothly that i used to just sit and admire that
                whole day. u were the person i swore to marry. In situations where i used to always panic and act so immature, u were chill and told me "its okay, i have
                a proper solution to this problem". U taught me how to talk to anyone in the world without any fear of making a bad impression. when i saw you, i fell in love
                with you the exact moment. I didnt care what face u had behind that mask. when i saw u speak, i couldnt behold such a confident and mature voice.
                i dont think u ever made any mistakes. U were the definition of my dream woman. u never lied for anything except one. whenever we used to vc, u always 
                appreciated me. we used to sleep on discord call and wake up in morning getting ready on call and cutting the call when we reach college. I was shocked,
                i was so shocked that even after being with shristi the whole day, u never shared anything or showed any interest in their stupid matters.
                Their matters never made u curious or interested. i used to see how obsessed every girl was in college with you. I never saw u approaching any girl,
                i saw them following u like they were ur servents. I saw that no matter what, this girl is the definition of perfection, studies, gaming, music, selfawareness,
                cooking, cleaning, maturity, discipline, moral values, always stay like a secret everyone wants to know, There was nothing u werent bad at mashallah.
                <br><br>
                i want you to be like this again. I want to u to stay silent and smart. Become like a queen which looks naturally so blessed. Blessed with so many 
                unlimited and unfiltered qualities, no one in this world had. So ? will you ?
